          <h5>User Registration / Membership Information</h5>
          <p>
            When you register as a user of our programs/services, we ask for personal and demographic information from you. At a minimum, we may ask for your name, email address, contact address, zip code, and any other information from which your identity is discernible. We may also afford you the opportunity to provide descriptive, cultural, preferential, and/or lifestyle information about you, but it is solely up to you whether you furnish such information. We do this so we can better understand what you like and tailor our services to suit you better. The more information you volunteer, the more we can tailor our services to your interests. Once you register with and sign in to our programs/services, you may no longer be anonymous to us. The information you provide helps us, and our third-party service providers make our services more practical and useful for you.

Moreover, there is information about your computer hardware and software that is or may be collected by us. This information can include without limitation your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times, and referring website addresses, but is not linked to your personal information. We would be collecting all information with no such intentions of using it commercially or in any other harmful ways.

We may use your contact information in order to send you emails or other communications regarding updates on our sites, and if you have information on new opportunities which may be of interest to you.
